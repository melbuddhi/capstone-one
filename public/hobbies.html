    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have many interests outside of my work, and try to keep myself engaged in these activities to clear my mind & create something new.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing</li>
        <li>Video Editing</li>
        <li>Photography</li>
        <li>Film-making (yet to make one)</li>
        <li>Trekking</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>This page showcases my creative side, and right now I see you thinking "Okay, that's not creative at all". And, I would agree.</p>
    <p>Come again in future, and if I am still doing this; I will surprise you.</p>
